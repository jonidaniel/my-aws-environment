# My AWS Environment

- Scripts categorized by services in my AWS account:
- Athena SQL queries,
- EC2 instance user data scripts,
- Lambda functions in JS and Python,
- HTML and CSS files of websites and web apps stored in S3 buckets,
- and more.

Note that the repository doesn't work as a standalone executable, the scripts are merely copied here from their original environment.
