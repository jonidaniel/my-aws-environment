Author: Joni Mäkinen [@jonidaniel](https://github.com/jonidaniel)

Repository contains scripts categorized by services in my AWS account:

- Athena SQL queries,
- EC2 instance user data scripts,
- Lambda functions in JS and Python,
- HTML and CSS files of websites and web apps stored in S3 buckets,
- and more.

Note that the repo doesn't work as a standalone executable, the scripts are merely copied here from their original environment (AWS Cloud).
